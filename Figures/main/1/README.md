<strong>a</strong>, Presence, absence and replicate indication of samples and data types for treatment-naive samples (cohort I). Metastases other than omentum were defined as ‘other’. Samples from the same tumor are indicated with a connecting horizontal line ([Supplementary Fig. 2a](https://www.google.com)). Pseudoreplicates are samples from the same tumor and habitat but from a different region within the habitat (see Methods). Age, age at diagnosis; BRCA, BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status (Neg, negative; NA, data not available); WES, whole-exome sequencing; IF, immunofluorescence staining. Extended clinical data can be found in Supplementary Table 1a,b. <strong>b</strong>, Flowchart of sample acquisition and analysis. <strong>c</strong>, t-SNE analysis of overall transcriptional profiles of multiple HGSOC tumor samples for each patient. <strong>d</strong>, PCA of ssGSEA- based analysis of cancer hallmark gene sets. <strong>e</strong>, Principal-component feature loadings (magnitude and direction) from c shown in the variables factor map. Vectors are colored according to a major biological classification of cancer hallmark gene sets. Variation across classes in the principal components is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1c. Directionality of ESTIMATE’s tumor cellularity is represented with the map compass (n = 38 samples from n = 8 independent patients). Inset, 95% nonparametric bootstrap confidence intervals for the means of loadings per hallmark gene set for PC1 (n = 36 samples from n = 8 independent patients). Approximated bootstrap P values were calculated (see Methods; *P <  0.05, **P < 0.01; immune versus oncogenic P ≈ 0.01; stroma versus oncogenic P ≈  0.008). <strong>f</strong>, ESTIMATE immune score across patients and samples. Case study samples were taken from ref. [7]. Box plots show the median, interquartile range (25th and 75th percentiles) and 1.5 times the interquartile range. All samples are plotted.

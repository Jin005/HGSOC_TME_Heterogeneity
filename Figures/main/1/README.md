<strong>a</strong>, Presence, absence and replicate indication of samples and data types for treatment-naive samples (cohort I). Metastases other than omentum were defined as ‘other’. Samples from the same tumor are indicated with a connecting horizontal line (<a href="https://github.com/cansysbio/HGSOC_TME_Heterogeneity/tree/Figures/Figures/supplementary/2">Supplementary Fig. 2a</a>). Pseudoreplicates are samples from the same tumor and habitat but from a different region within the habitat (see Methods). Age, age at diagnosis; BRCA, <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> mutation status (Neg, negative; NA, data not available); WES, whole-exome sequencing; IF, immunofluorescence staining. Extended clinical data can be found in <a href="https://github.com/cansysbio/HGSOC_TME_Heterogeneity/tree/Tables/Tables/supplementary">Supplementary Table 1a,  b</a>. <strong>b</strong>, Flowchart of sample acquisition and analysis. <strong>c</strong>, t-SNE analysis of overall transcriptional profiles of multiple HGSOC tumor samples for each patient. <strong>d</strong>, PCA of ssGSEA- based analysis of cancer hallmark gene sets. <strong>e</strong>, Principal-component feature loadings (magnitude and direction) from <strong>c</strong> shown in the variables factor map. Vectors are colored according to a major biological classification of cancer hallmark gene sets. Variation across classes in the principal components is shown in <a href="https://github.com/cansysbio/HGSOC_TME_Heterogeneity/tree/Figures/Figures/supplementary/1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</a>. Directionality of ESTIMATE’s tumor cellularity is represented with the map compass (n = 38 samples from n = 8 independent patients). Inset, 95% nonparametric bootstrap confidence intervals for the means of loadings per hallmark gene set for PC1 (n = 36 samples from n = 8 independent patients). Approximated bootstrap P values were calculated (see Methods; *P <  0.05, **P < 0.01; immune versus oncogenic P ≈ 0.01; stroma versus oncogenic P ≈  0.008). <strong>f</strong>, ESTIMATE immune score across patients and samples. Case study samples were taken from ref. [7]. Box plots show the median, interquartile range (25th and 75th percentiles) and 1.5 times the interquartile range. All samples are plotted.

<strong>a</strong>, Multitumor sampling from eight patients with HGSOC is shown, with each dot representing the percentage of T-cell subsets in a quantified area within a given tumor section stained with multicolor IF for CD8, CD4 and FOXP3. Stromal areas were excluded based on haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains. Patients are indicated by different colors. Image-based phenotypic habitats are defined by the Greek letters α, β and γ. Habitats from the same tumor sample are indicated by connecting lines at the bottom (<a href="https://github.com/cansysbio/HGSOC_TME_Heterogeneity/tree/Figures/Figures/supplementary/2">Supplementary Fig. 2a</a>). Box plots are sorted according to the median of CD8+ T-cell infiltration across patients, sites and habitats. Box plots show the median, interquartile range (25th and 75th percentiles) and 1.5 times the interquartile range. The regions from all samples are plotted. The two pseudoreplicates in patient 05 are indicated with a diagonal line in the tumor site symbol (n = 440 observations of n = 8 independent patients with n = 38 total samples; <a href="https://github.com/cansysbio/HGSOC_TME_Heterogeneity/tree/Figures/Figures/supplementary/2">Supplementary Table 2</a>). <strong>b</strong>, Representative images of <strong>a</strong>.

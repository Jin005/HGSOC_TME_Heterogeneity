<strong>a</strong>, Coding mutations and CNAs in selected driver oncogenes and tumor suppressors based on known drivers in HGSOC. Tumor–normal DNA pairs (n = 47 independent tumor site samples from n = 10 independent patients, n = 3 pseudoreplicates) were sequenced using WES and analyzed for CNAs using TITAN, resulting in estimates of tumor ploidy, cellularity and subclonality. The top and side bars represent the summed column-wise and row-wise number of alterations, respectively. *, † and ‡ indicate pairs of pseudoreplicates (Fig. 1a). <strong>b</strong>, DNA copy number signature analysis showing tumor-specific exposure to all seven signatures ordered by tumor cellularity (TITAN), selecting samples with high-confidence purity and ploidy estimates (n = 42 samples from n = 10 independent patients). <strong>c</strong>, Association of copy number signature 4 with immune score. Using samples with both mRNA and WES data, the ESTIMATE immune score was compared between samples (n = 30; Welch’s two-sided t-test) with signature 4 exposure lower and higher than the median exposure (low and high s4, respectively). In box plots, the median is indicated by the midline; boxes represent quartiles 1–3; and whiskers extend to extreme values at 1.5 times the interquartile range. <strong>d</strong>, Functional mutation enrichment and tumor cellularity associations per hallmark gene set were tested through the chi-squared likelihood-ratio test using the tumor mutation load and the patient dependency as covariates. The difference in mean pathway mutation ratio between samples with high cellularity versus samples with low cellularity (WES- derived tumor cellularity from TITAN, n = 50 samples) is plotted against FDR- corrected P values (BH and Yekutieli) from multiple linear regression (tumor cellularity ~ mutation ratio; n = 50 samples). <strong>e</strong>, GSEA of gene-level correlations between absolute copy numbers and gene expression (CNA ~ mRNA; per-gene median, n = 36 samples) compared to enrichment in correlations between gene expression and tumor cellularity (mRNA ~ tumor cellularity; n = 36 samples), both estimated by Spearman’s rank correlation (see Methods). BH-FDR correction was performed, adjusting for the number of hallmark terms. Normality and homoscedasticity assumptions were tested for all statistical comparisons.

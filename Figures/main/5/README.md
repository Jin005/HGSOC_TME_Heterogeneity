<strong>a</strong>, Presence, absence and replicate indication of samples and data types for the pre- and post-chemotherapy site-matched and site-unmatched samples (cohort II). Extended clinical data can be found in Supplementary Table 5. <strong>b</strong>, Flowchart of sample acquisition, clinical study design and analysis. <strong>c</strong>, t-SNE analysis of overall transcription profiles of multiple HGSOC tumor samples for each patient. <strong>d</strong>,<strong>e</strong>, PCA and principal-component feature projections (magnitude and direction) of ssGSEA- based analysis of hallmark gene sets (d) and ConsensusTME cells (e). Insets show paired PC1 comparison of pre- and post-treatment samples. Inset violin plots represent the full probability density of the data. Paired samples are connected with a line. Two-sided paired t-tests were conducted for hallmark gene sets, while Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were conducted for the ConsensusTME gene-set PC1 comparison. Normality and homoscedasticity assumptions were tested for all statistical comparisons. P values were not corrected for multiple testing because the maximum number of tests within the analysis was two (c). *P  <  0.05.

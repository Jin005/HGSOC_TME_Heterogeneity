<strong>a</strong>, Pre- and post-NACT paired comparisons of hallmark gene sets and ConsensusTME inferred cells. A paired t-test, Welch’s t-test or Wilcoxon’s signed- rank test (all two-sided) was used according to the samples’ distribution and variance (see Methods). BH-FDR P-value corrections were computed. <strong>b</strong>, Histograms (left) show multivariate analysis of cell type combinations associated with NACT (two-sided Hotelling’s T2 permutation test), and notched box plots (right) compare pre- and post-NACT samples for sums (+) of cell scores: cytotoxic cells (that is, signature of cytolytic activity from ConsensusTME) and CD8+ T cells or NK cells (multiple linear regression without interaction; Supplementary Fig. 6a; n = 8 independent patients; n = 18 matched samples (top) and n = 38 unmatched samples (bottom)). Notched box plots show the median and interquartile range (25th and 75th percentiles), with paired data points indicated by a connecting line. Violin plots represent the probability density of the data. <strong>c</strong>, Flow cytometry analysis of homogenized tumors after UKP10 intraperitoneal inoculation of 8- week-old C57BL/6 mice and treatment with 2 mg of cisplatin dissolved in 1 ml of PBS or 1 ml of PBS as the control as indicated. Analyzed immune cell types were CD8+ effector T cells, NK1.1+ NK cells, CD4+ helper T cells, FOXP3+ Treg cells, CD19+ B cells and CD11b+ myeloid cells. Granzyme B (GrB) expression was used as a proxy for the activity state of cytotoxic cells. Two-sided two-sample independent t-tests were conducted for CD8+ T cells, and two-sided Welch’s tests were conducted for NK cells. <strong>d</strong>, Similar to c except the peritoneal fluids of mice intraperitoneally inoculated with ID8 cells were analyzed. Data for CD4+ helper T cells, FOXP3+ Treg cells, CD19+ B cells and CD11b+ myeloid cells are shown in Supplementary Fig. 6f,g. Two-sided two-sample independent t-tests were conducted for CD8+ T cells and GrB+ NK cells among NK cells, while two-sided Welch’s tests were conducted for the remaining NK cell comparisons. Violin plots represent the full probability density of the data. All samples are plotted. Normality and homoscedasticity assumptions were tested for all statistical comparisons.

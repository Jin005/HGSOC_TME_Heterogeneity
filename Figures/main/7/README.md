<strong>a</strong>, Comparisons of the percentage of productive T cells (top), TCR productive clonality (middle) and maximum productive TCR frequencies (bottom) between pre- and post-NACT site-matched and site-unmatched samples. Paired (matched samples) parametric (TCR clonality and frequency) and nonparametric Wilcoxon (percentage of T cells) two-sided t-tests were computed. Unpaired (unmatched samples) nonparametric Wilcoxon (percentage of T cells, TCR clonality and frequency) two-sided t-tests were computed. TCR clonality is expressed as 1 â€“ entropy with values near 1 representing samples with one or a few predominant TCR rearrangements, while values near 0 represent more polyclonal samples. Notched box plots show the median and interquartile range (25th and 75th percentiles), with paired data points indicated by a connecting line. Violin plots are shown in the background representing the full probability density of the data. <strong>b</strong>, Shared and unique TCR amino acid sequences between pre- and post-NACT site- matched and site-unmatched samples. A chi-squared test of the independence of variables was conducted. <strong>c</strong>, Distributions of shared TCR amino acid sequences between patient samples before and after NACT. A one-way chi-squared test was conducted. <strong>d</strong>, The number of shared and unique TCRs before and after NACT in site-matched and site-unmatched samples (top) and their productive frequencies (bottom). Notched box plots show the median and interquartile range (25th and 75th percentiles), 1.5 times the interquartile range (top) and outliers. Violin plots represent the full probability density of the data. The widths of box and violin plots are proportional to the number of samples (top) and TCRs (bottom). Friedman ranking tests followed by Nemenyi post hoc tests with associated adjusted P values (q) were conducted. P values were not corrected for multiple testing because the maximum number of tests within the analysis was six (<strong>a</strong>). Normality and homoscedasticity assumptions were tested for all statistical comparisons.

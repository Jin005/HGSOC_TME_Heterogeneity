<strong>a</strong>, Whole transcriptome and protein coding transcriptome clustering, colored by patient sample or WES-derived (TITAN) tumor cellularity binned as high or low using median value as cut-off. <strong>b</strong>, Correlation of transcriptome-derived (ESTIMATE) and WES-derived (TITAN) tumor cellularity estimations. Pearson’s rho correlation and a two-sided P value exact test were conducted. <strong>c</strong>, Principal components’ loadings (top) and loadings of hallmarks for each principal component sorted in groups according to the gene sets’ classes defined (bottom). <strong>d</strong>, 95% non-parametric bootstrap confidence intervals for the means of loadings per hallmark gene set for PC1 (N = 36 samples from n = 8 independent patients). Approximated bootstrap P values for two-sided tests were calculated (see Methods) ns P > 0.05. <strong>e</strong>, Hierarchically-clustered heatmap of normalized enrichment scores (NES). Hallmark gene sets (rows) and tumor samples (columns). Normalized tumor cellularity values between 0 and 1 shown on top. High, medium and low refer to the tumor cellularity clusters. <strong>f</strong>, Hierarchically-clustered heatmap of hallmark gene sets’ gene overlaps. <strong>g</strong>, Overall and patient-specific correlations between Wnt β catenin signaling pathway and immune signature NES. Kendall’s tau-b correlation with two-sided P value asymptotic tests or Pearson’s rho correlation with two-sided P value exact tests were conducted according to the normality and homoscedasticity of the data. <strong>h</strong>, Comparison of Wnt β catenin signaling pathway NES between high and low tumor cellularity samples WES-derived (TITAN) tumor cellularity median value as cut-off. Notched box plots show median and interquartile range (25th and 75th percentiles). Violin plots are shown in the background representing the full probability density of the data. Widths of box and violin plots are proportional to the number of samples. Two-sided Mann-Whitney rank test was conducted. Normality and homoscedasticity assumptions were tested for all statistical comparisons. P values were not corrected for multiple testing since the maximum number of tests within analysis was nine (panel <strong>g</strong>).

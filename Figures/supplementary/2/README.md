<strong>a</strong>, Examples of cases, tumors’ sites and habitats defined within tumors. <strong>b</strong>, Immunofluorescent total CD8+, CD4+, and Tregs (CD4+/FoxP3+) counts. 440 different regions (multiple regions per sample per patient, i.e. non-independent) from 8 independent patients were scanned and computationally quantified. Notched box plots are sorted according to <a href="https://github.com/cansysbio/HGSOC_TME_Heterogeneity/tree/Figures/Figures/main/2">Fig. 2a</a>. Notched box plots show median, interquartile range (25th and 75th percentiles), and 1.5x interquartile range. All samples’ regions are plotted. <strong>c</strong>, 95% percentile confidence intervals for the standard deviations of hierarchical random-effect models fitting the T cell fractions of interest. Approximate P values for the two- sided test of equality of standard deviations obtained by means of parametric bootstraps considering 10,000 replicates were calculated (see Methods). P values were not corrected for multiple testing since the maximum number of tests within analysis was twelve (panel <strong>c</strong>).

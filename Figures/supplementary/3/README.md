<strong>a</strong>, Consensus<sup>TME</sup> gene sets generation flowchart. Numbers in brackets = number of methods estimating that cell-type. <strong>b</strong>, Gene set overlaps between Consensus<sup>TME</sup> gene sets, and T cell infiltration correlates showing similar associations (i.e. high CD8+ and CD4+ gene sets overlap is recapitulated in the IF quantification correlates). Kendall’s tau-b correlation with two-sided p-value asymptotic tests were calculated. <strong>c</strong>, Sensitivity analysis of leukocyte methylation benchmark without data transformation related to <a href="https://github.com/cansysbio/HGSOC_TME_Heterogeneity/tree/Figures/Figures/main/3">Fig. 3b</a> (Supplementary Note). <strong>d</strong>, Hierarchically-clustered heatmap of normalized enrichment scores. Consensus<sup>TME</sup> gene sets (rows) and tumor samples (columns). Normalized tumor cellularity values between 0 and 1 shown on top. <strong>e</strong>, Principal components’ loadings (top) and of Consensus<sup>TME</sup> gene sets for each principal component sorted (bottom). <strong>f</strong>, PCA of ssGSEA-based analysis using Consensus<sup>TME</sup> estimations and Principal component feature loadings (magnitude and direction) of PC1 and 2. Vectors are colored according to cell types as shown in s3a (N = 38 samples from n = 8 independent patients). <strong>g</strong>, Correlation of immune signature and Wnt- and Myc v2 normalized enrichment scores (NES) of TCGA ovarian cancer samples (N = 307 independent samples). Kendall’s tau-b correlations and two-sided p-value asymptotic tests were conducted. <strong>h</strong>, Overall and patient-specific correlations between Myc v2 signaling pathway and immune signature NES for the treatment-naive HGSOC cohort. Kendall’s tau-b correlation with two-sided p-value asymptotic tests or Pearson’s rho correlation with two-sided p-value exact tests were conducted according to the normality and homoscedasticity of the data. <strong>i</strong>, Comparison of Myc v2 signaling pathway NES between high and low tumor cellularity samples WES-derived (TITAN) tumor cellularity median value as cut-off. Notched box plots show median and interquartile range (25th and 75th percentiles). Violin plots are shown in the background representing the full probability density of the data. Widths of box and violin plots are proportional to the number of samples. Two-sided independent t-test was conducted. Normality and homoscedasticity assumptions were tested for all statistical comparisons. P values were not corrected for multiple testing since the maximum number of tests within analysis was nine (panel <strong>h</strong>).

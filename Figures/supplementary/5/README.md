<strong>a</strong>, Whole transcriptome hierarchical clustering of the pre/post chemotherapy treated HGSOC samples. <strong>b</strong>, Hierarchically-clustered heatmap of hallmarks’ NES. Hallmarks gene sets (rows) and tumor samples (columns). Normalized mRNA-derived tumor cellularity values between 0 and 1 shown on top. High, medium and low refer to the tumor cellularity clusters. Question mark refer to no clear clustering related to tumor cellularity. <strong>c</strong>, Principal components’ loadings (top) and loadings of hallmarks for each principal component sorted in groups according to the gene sets’ classes defined (bottom). <strong>d</strong>, Overall correlations between immune signature and Wnt (top) and Myc v2 (bottom) signaling pathway NES. Kendall’s tau-b correlation coefficients and two-sided P value asymptotic tests were calculated. Normality and homoscedasticity assumptions were tested for all statistical comparisons. <strong>e</strong>, Hierarchically-clustered heatmap of ConsensusTME normalized enrichment scores (NES). ConsensusTME gene sets (rows) and tumor samples (columns). Normalized mRNA-derived tumor cellularity values between 0 and 1 shown on top. High, medium and low refer to the tumor cellularity clusters. Question mark refer to no clear clustering related to tumor cellularity. f, Principal components’ loadings (top) and loadings of ConsensusTME for each principal component sorted (bottom).

<strong>a</strong>, Results and multiple linear regression models using Consensus<sup>TME</sup> gene set NES as explanatory variables and categorical pre/post-NACT as response variable. Two-sided P value t-tests were computed (N = 9 independent patients, n = 18 matched paired samples; and N = 19 independent patients, n = 38 unamctech paired samples). <strong>b</strong>, Logistic regression analysis for NK and CD8+ T cells in combination with the Cytotoxic gene set, independently. Chi-squared test was conducted. (N = 9 independent patients, n = 18 matched paired samples; and N = 19 independent patients, n = 38 unamctech paired samples). <strong>c</strong>, An ID8 clone with enhanced in vivo growth capacity was selected by serial passaging through mice twice. The resultant cell line was transduced with luciferase (ID8- fluc) and was used in all of the experiments. B6(Cg)-Tyrc-2j/J (C57BL/6J albino) mice were implanted with 1x10<sup>6</sup> ID8-fluc cells and were followed for survival. Representative luminescence images are shown. <strong>d</strong>, Composite luminescence measurements over time derived from <strong>c</strong>. <strong>e</strong>, B6(Cg)-Tyrc-2j/J (C57BL/6J albino) mice were implanted with 1x10<sup>6</sup> ID8-fluc cells and were treated with cisplatin on days 11, 13, 15, and 17. The mice were subsequently weighed (left panel) and followed for survival (right panel) and were sacrificed when total body weight was increased by 10g over baseline due to ascites. Each data point indicates an average photon flux with n = 4 (for days 7-21) and n = 3 for day 28. Error bars represent standard deviations for each measurement. <strong>f</strong>, Flow cytometry analysis of homogenized tumors after UKP10 intraperitoneal inoculation of 8 weeks old C57/BL6 mice and treatment with 2mg of cisplatin dissolved in 1ml of PBS or 1ml PBS as control as indicated. Analyzed immune cell types were CD8+ T-effector cells, NK1.1+ NK cells, CD4+ T-helper cells, FOXP3+ T-regulatory cells, CD19+ B cells, CD11b+ myeloid cells. Granzyme B (GrB) expression was used as a proxy for the activity state of cytotoxic cells. Two-sided two-sample independent t-tests were conducted for CD4+ T cells and Myeloid cells out of all live cells while two-sided Welch’s tests were conducted for CD4 helper T cells, Tregs, and Myeloid cells out of CD45+ cells. Data represent one representative experiment (out of 3) with 10 mice per group. Left panel represents average weights with standard deviations; measurements were stopped when the first animal in each respective group died. Statistical comparisons between average animal weights on day 34 were performed using two-sided student’s t-test. Right panel represents survival with 10 mice per group. Survival analysis was performed using a two-sided log-rank test. <strong>g</strong>, Similar to <strong>f</strong>, except peritoneal fluids of intraperitoneally inoculated ID8 cells were analyzed. CD8+ T-effector cells, NK1.1+ NK cells are shown in Figs. 6b,c. Two-sided two-sample independent t-tests were conducted for all comparisons. Violin plots are shown in the background representing the full probability density of the data. All samples are plotted. Two-sided independent t-test or Welch’s t-test were conducted. Normality and homoscedasticity assumptions were tested for all statistical comparisons. P values were not corrected for multiple testing since the maximum number of tests within analysis was eight (panel <strong>g</strong>).

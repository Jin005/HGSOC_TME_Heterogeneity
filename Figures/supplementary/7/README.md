<strong>a</strong>, Tumor cellularity (ESTIMATE) and immune signature NES. Two-sample two-sided t-tests were computed for pre and post treated tumor cellularity comparisons. Two-sample two-sided Mann-Whitney rank test was computed for pre-treated immune signature NES comparison and a two-sample two-sided t-test was computed for post-treated immune NES comparison. Boxplots with median midline, boxes representing the 1 to 3 quartiles and whiskers extending to extreme values at most 1.5 times the interquartile range. Violin plots are shown in the background representing the full probability density of the data. The number of independent matched samples is n = 9 and the number of independent unmatched samples is n = 19. <strong>b</strong>, Matched/Unmatched unpaired comparisons of Consensus<sup>TME</sup> inferred cells. Two-sample two-sided Mann-Whitney rank test was computed for pre and post-treated percentage of T cells, TCR clonality, and TCR frequency comparisons (see Methods). BH FDR P value corrections were calculated. Consensus<sup>TME</sup> gene sets comparison. <strong>c</strong>, Comparisons of percentage of productive T cells (left), TCR productive clonality (middle), and maximum productive TCR frequencies (right) between pre- and post-NACT site-matched and site-unmatched samples. Independent parametric (two-sided independent t-test) or non-parametric (Mann-Whitney U test) were conducted accordingly. Boxplots with median midline, boxes representing the 1 to 3 quartiles and whiskers extending to extreme values at most 1.5 times the interquartile range. Violin plots are shown in the background representing the full probability density of the data. Widths of box and violin plots are proportional to the number of samples. Normality and homoscedasticity assumptions were tested for all statistical comparisons. <strong>d</strong>, Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis using the pre-NACT matched (n = 8 samples) hallmarks and Consensus<sup>TME</sup> cells NES together (left) or separately hallmark NES (middle) and Consensus<sup>TME</sup> (right) as explanatory variables, and the log2 of the TCR clonality ratio of post/pre-NACT samples as response variable (see Methods). Note that several hallmark pathways and Consensus<sup>TME</sup> scaled predictors showed interesting positive association and potential predictive power including G2M checkpoint, Myc and Wnt signaling and UV response. DF: Degrees of freedom. The variables selected by the LASSO regression are indicated with an asterisk. <strong>e</strong>, Kendallâ€™s tau-b correlation of pre-NACT NES (scaled and centered) of selected gene sets and log2 of the post/pre-NACT TCR clonality ratio with two-sided P value exact test were calculated. Note that although not statistically significant, we observed a trend where apoptosis and the immune signatures were negatively correlated with TCR clonal increase after NACT, while G2M showed the opposite.
